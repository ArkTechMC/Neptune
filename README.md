# Neptune

**Neptune** is a cross-platform utility library. It's primarily used for my animation fan work mods. (Also you can tell
this mod as *Animation Fan Work Engine*)

This library don't directly use any apis from fml or fabric api. You can safely use it in the `common` subproject
of `Architectury`

### What provided

1.Simple event system & extra event hooks

2.Some package for Item, Entity and so on. Also include some hooks.

3.A lot of functional interfaces

And so on!
